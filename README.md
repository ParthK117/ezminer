# EzMiner
This is my brand new GUI Miner for cryptonight and cryptolight coins, which I made after the success of my ETN CPU GPU Miner.
More information can be found at https://parthk.co.uk
Backend is powered by xmr-stak by psychocrypt & fireice-uk, all donations from using their 2% executable goes directly to them.

Here is the changelog from 0.2.1 of the original EzMiner (But to be honest this one is basically built from the ground up and doesn't share anything besides the name with 0.2.1) to this version.

     Brand new GUI
     Automatic scraping through ez_ticker for the value of cryptocurrencies (max 4 at the moment)
     Automatic hashrate reporting within the miner itself for ALL pools (does not use external APIs for hashrate)
     Live pool list that can be updated in realtime without updating the miner itself.
     Check ETN for nanopool within the miner (spacepool support coming soon)
    Check pool status before you begin mining. (WALLET ADDRESS REQUIRED FOR THIS)
    Automatic error reporting (if your miner fails to start it tells you exactly why and how to fix it)
    Supports multiple coins! This is something the original one couldn't do.

Donate:

If youâ€™d like to donate and make sure that I can continue making free tools you can either mine for me using the miner (using the prefilled url in the current miner v0.2.1) or send crypto to the following addresses:

BTC: 2TLz1CuQyNfeTf2jJgQxcQQCLWNPLPq2U
ETN: etnkAjckxKuQ2ov3QVmJRWJserxDuFpQJNKud22TN79PhJFtmd7FtDLLGpyErzEWM47W7JVsbXeVfTgmuUPsUAaX81rdJrMtJw

There is no longer a way to donate to me within the Miner as I thought it detracted from the ease of use.
Let me know what new things I can add!
